<h1>Three ways of repeating a string in JavaScript</h1>

Repeat a given ```string``` (first argument) ```num``` times (second argument). 
Return an empty ```string``` if ```num``` is not a positive number.

1. using a while loop
2. using recursion
3. using ES6 repeat() method

<h3>While</h3>
A while statement executes its statement as long as a specified condition evaluates to true




<h3>Recursion</h3>
Key features of recursion that must be included in order for it to work properly:

- The first is a *base case*: this is a statement, usually within a conditional clause like ```if```, that stops the recursion.
- The second is a *recursive case*: this is the statement where the recursive function is called on itself.


<h3>repeat() method</h3>
Use the string.prototype.repeat() method.
The repeat() method constructs and returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together.
